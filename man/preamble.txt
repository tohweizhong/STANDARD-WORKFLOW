STANDARD-WORKFLOW

----

OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this workflow to streamline all analytics done on any structured and relatively clean datasets. Such datasets include Kaggle competitions, mainly on supervised learning only.

XY-CONVENTION
There are two versions of workflow in the repo: one using the xy-convention (xy workflow) and one not (non-xy workflow). The xy-convention refers to the use of variables such as Xtrain and ytest, throughout the workflow. One implication of such a convention is that functions that train the model are mostly to be used in a x = Xtrain, y = Ytrain manner rather than using a formula.

For the xy workflow, the dataset used is the Titanic dataset, from Kaggle. The non-xy workflow uses the adult dataset. Both are classification problems.

MODELLING
Models involved are:
* Logistic regression (log)
* Naive Bayesian classifier (nbc)
* Random forest (rf)
* Extreme gradient boosting (xgb)

Evaluation metrics are:
* Accuracy (acc)
* ROC-AUC (auc)
* Cross-entropy loss (cel)

PACKAGES
Packages involved in this workflow are:
* caret
* DMwR
* (Most of the packages involved are interfaced via the caret package)

SCRIPTS
* preprocess.R: preprocess data and feature engineering
* houseBlend.R: utility functions
* <model>.R: respective models, includes tuning, testing etc.
* preprocess.R will source houseBlend.R, <model>.R's will not source any scripts
