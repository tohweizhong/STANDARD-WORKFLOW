CODING CONVENTIONS

Variables (General, e.g. as function arguments)
* Use periods as delimiter
* df for data.frame
* idx for indices (usually rows)
* tmp, ump, vmp etc. for temporary variables
* xmp and ymp for temporary variables related to X and Y

Variables (Names in xy-convention)
* Xtrain and Xtest for original training and testing set, without response variable
* Ytrain for original response variable in training set (Ytest shouldn't exist)
* xtrain, xtune, xtest for data partitions within Xtrain
* ytrain, ytune, ytest: likewise

Variables (Names in non-xy-convention)
* 

Models (General)
* Models are indexed by numbers, starting from 0
* New models with params tweaked are indicated by <model><index>.<parameter><value>, e.g rf1.mtry2, up to 2 parameters only. Anything more than that, write a comment to describe the exact parameter tweak

Products of modeling
* Predictions are named <model><index>.<pred>.<prob or class> depending on probability or class predictions
* Submissions are with "subm"
* Confusion matrices are with "conf"
* Performances metrics: .acc for accuracy, .auc for ROC-AUC

Functions
* All functions are to start with caps
* Functions related to feature engineering start with "Eng"", followed by the name of the variable to be engineered
* All functions are named using CamelCase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase)
